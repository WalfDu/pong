# TIPE project: Generalise the old pong game to several players

Authors: Alexandre Liban, Antoine Jeanneney, Raphaël Durandy

As it was our first project (we weren't well organised), all the script is in few html files, but full of javascript.
You can play here:
https://walfal.github.io/pong/

How to play:

We will suggest you two options: the circle or the polygon version, you can switch between each game.
Enter the number of players.
You can set the victory score and difficulty.
By default, all players move their paddles with «left arrow» and «right arrow», you can change it hitting the key in each case.

You win points if you are the latest player who hit the ball. You win a number of point equals to the number of hit during the round.
You loose half of thoses points if you miss the ball.

**Have a good game**
